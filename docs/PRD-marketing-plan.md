## Positioning & Messaging

### Value Proposition

> **Protect your arm. Extend your career.**  
> Elbow Enforcer is the only patented device designed to prevent UCL injuries and eliminate the need for Tommy John surgery—so you can keep playing the game you love.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Patented Technology** — Only device specifically engineered for UCL protection during throwing motion
2. **Prevention-First Approach** — Not just rehab; designed to prevent injury before it happens
3. **Founder Credibility** — Built by Lee Fiocchi with deep baseball and sports medicine expertise
4. **Dual Use** — Works for both prevention (healthy players) and rehabilitation (recovering players)

### Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Elbow Enforcer Advantage |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Do Nothing | $500K+ Tommy John surgery costs, 12-18 month recovery |
| Rest/Pitch Counts | Still leaves arm vulnerable during play |
| Traditional Braces | Not designed for throwing mechanics |
| Iron Neck (neck training) | Different body part—complementary, not competitive |

### Core Messaging Framework

**For Youth Baseball Parents:**
> "Your son's dream shouldn't end with Tommy John surgery. Elbow Enforcer gives competitive young pitchers the protection they need to keep playing—and keep their UCL healthy."

**For Physical Therapists:**
> "Give your patients a better recovery path. Elbow Enforcer is the first device designed specifically for UCL rehabilitation, helping athletes return to play faster and safer."

**For Coaches/Organizations:**
> "Protect your investment. One Tommy John surgery sidelines your player for 18 months. Elbow Enforcer helps prevent career-altering injuries before they happen."
